## Smelvetica

!["Kerning"](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/kerning.png)

Helvetica for your best friends, or your worst enemies.
 
### What is it?

Smelvetica is a craftily edited version of the infamously robust Helvetica. The kerning has been specially altered, to be ... well, bad, terrible, awful and painful.

Here are some examples:

### How do I install it?

Installing Smelvetica on your system (mac only, at the moment) means that all renderings of Helvetica will use Smelvetica, including websites and applications. The installation is fairly simple!

1. Download Smelvetica (or Smelvetica Neue) from [here](where?)

2. Open the file in fontbook (double clicking should do it)

3. Click "install"

4. Ignore the conflicts (this is the old Helvetica holding on for dear life)

5. For the fully serious, you can manually resolve these conflicts, by selecting the "new" version.

6. Watch your target be confused, and frustrated... but ultimately have to live with it.
